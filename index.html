<H1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</H1>

  <body>
  		And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.
  </body>


<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

<h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>

<body>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
<ul>

<li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
<li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
<li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>

</ul>

</body>

<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

<body>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.

</body>

<h2>Let it breathe</h2>

<body>
  Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
</p>

</body>


<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

<body>
  Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.

</body>

<h2>Size Matters</h2>

<body>
  I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.


</body>

<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

<body>
  Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.


</body>


<h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

<body>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
